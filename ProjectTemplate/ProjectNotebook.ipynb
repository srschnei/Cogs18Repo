    "##### This chat bot, CatBot, has a purpose of providing fun, factual knowledge (and cat-like jargon) towards the chat user. As notated within the facts provided when asking questions (in the who, what, where, when, and why categories), cats are interesting and prevelant creatures within the scope of history. This CatBot is interested in providing this information, with the assumption that whoever conversates with it has an interest (or potential future interest) in cats. Still, CatBot can get rather moody, depending on what topic is brought up. Have fun and be sure to provide digital pets!"
